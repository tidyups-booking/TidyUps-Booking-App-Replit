# Product Blueprint: AI Receptionist for Jobber Cleaning Companies

*A sellable, self-serve version of the 833 Tidyups system — installable by any cleaning company from the Jobber App Marketplace.*

---

## 1. The Product in One Sentence

Any cleaning company using Jobber connects their account, picks a phone number, customizes what the AI receptionist asks callers, and gets live-transcribed calls that turn into bookings on their own Jobber calendar — no missed calls, no manual data entry.

## 2. What We Already Proved (in the 833 Tidyups app)

The single-company version is live at bookcleaning.app and working end-to-end:

- Real phone calls answered via Twilio, forwarded to the business line while an AI listens
- Live transcription streamed to a dispatcher dashboard in real time
- AI extracts caller name, address, service type, and preferred time during the call
- Two-way Jobber sync: bookings created/edited/canceled flow both directions
- Live cleaner GPS map, staff management, dispatcher access control (Clerk auth)
- Battle-tested plumbing: multi-instance-safe call state, single-use stream tokens, webhook bursts handled

**This is the prototype. The product wraps it in multi-company packaging.**

## 3. The Setup Wizard (the "expobuilder" experience)

New companies configure everything through a checklist-style wizard — no technical steps:

1. **Create account** → company workspace created (owner login)
2. **Connect Jobber** → one-click OAuth (same flow we built; the Jobber app just gets authorized against *their* account)
3. **Pick a phone number** → choose a local number in their area code (provisioned automatically via Twilio), or forward their existing number to it
4. **Customize the receptionist** — the core differentiator:
   - Business name + greeting script ("Thanks for calling Sunshine Cleaners!")
   - Check the questions the AI should collect: name, address, service type, home size, pets, preferred date, budget, how-did-you-hear
   - Add custom questions & answers ("Do you bring supplies?" → their answer)
   - Services & price ranges the AI can quote
   - Where to ring through: their business/cell number
5. **Invite the team** → dispatchers and cleaners get their own logins
6. **Go live** → test call button verifies everything before launch

## 4. What Must Change vs. the Single-Company App

| Area | Today (833 Tidyups) | Product version |
|---|---|---|
| Companies | One, hardcoded | Many — every table keyed by company; strict data isolation |
| Jobber | One connected account | Each company OAuths their own; webhooks routed by Jobber account ID |
| Phone | One Twilio number | One number per company (Twilio subaccounts), calls routed by dialed number |
| AI script | Fixed prompts | Driven by each company's wizard answers (questions, greeting, services) |
| Logins | One Clerk app, email allowlist | Clerk Organizations — each company is an org with owner/dispatcher/cleaner roles |
| Branding | 833 Tidyups | Neutral product brand + each company's name in their own dashboard |
| Billing | None | Subscription (Stripe) — e.g. free trial → monthly per-company plan |

## 5. Jobber Marketplace Requirements (verified from Jobber's docs)

- Submit via Developer Center → Manage Apps → "Request a review"
- Before submitting: **2FA enabled** on the developer account, **app logo uploaded**, pre-submission checklist completed
- Listing needs: app name, developer name, description, features/benefits, gallery screenshots (Manage App URL optional)
- Jobber tests the app themselves; high quality bar; they email to coordinate release
- No announcements/press until Jobber moves the app to "published"

## 6. Suggested Build Order

1. **Foundation** — multi-company data model, Clerk Organizations, company signup
2. **Jobber per-company OAuth** — reuse existing flow, store tokens per company, route webhooks
3. **Phone provisioning** — Twilio subaccount + number purchase per company, route inbound calls by dialed number
4. **Wizard + configurable AI script** — the expobuilder-style setup; AI prompts assembled from company config
5. **Dashboard** — the existing dispatcher panel, scoped per company
6. **Billing** — Stripe subscription, trial period
7. **Polish + marketplace assets** — logo, screenshots, listing copy, demo account for Jobber's reviewers
8. **Submit for Jobber review**

## 7. Open Product Decisions (for the owner)

- Product name & brand (can't lean on "833 Tidyups")
- Pricing (monthly flat? per-call? per-seat?) — phone minutes and AI transcription are per-call costs to cover
- Include the cleaner mobile app + GPS map in v1, or dashboard-only first?
- Beta strategy: free for 3–5 friendly cleaning companies before the marketplace listing?
